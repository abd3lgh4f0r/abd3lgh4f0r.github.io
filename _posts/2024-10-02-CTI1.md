**Threat Intelligence Fundamentals :  Part 1**

Hello friends, and welcome to a new blog!

I’ve decided to start a blog series on Cyber Threat Intelligence, where I’ll explore key topics in the field. To provide a solid foundation for the upcoming posts, I’ll begin by detailing the fundamentals of Cyber Threat Intelligence, which will be the focus of this blog.

**The Thing Called Intelligence**

Intelligence can be defined as the process of collecting and processing information about a competitive entity and its agents, which is necessary for an organization or group's security and well-being.

**Intelligence & Cybersecurity**

In the context of cybersecurity, **Threat Intelligence** refers to the analysis of information related to the hostile intent, capabilities, and opportunities of an adversary, aimed at addressing specific security requirements. It provides answers to critical questions such as:

- **Who**:  Identifies the adversaries or threat actors.
- **What**: Focuses on their capabilities and infrastructure.
- **Where**: Details the industries or sectors being targeted.
- **When**: Considers the timeliness and timing of the threat.
- **Why**: Examines the motives and intent behind the attack.
- **How**: Analyzes adversary behaviors, attack patterns, and techniques.

Additionally, effective threat intelligence must adhere to four key properties, summarized by the acronym **CART**:

- **Completeness**: The intelligence should be comprehensive and cover all necessary aspects of the threat.
- **Accuracy**: The information provided must be precise and reliable.
- **Relevance**: The intelligence should be pertinent to the organization or security context.
- **Timeliness**: It must be delivered in a timely manner to ensure effective threat mitigation.



**The Threat Intelligence Cycle :**

The threat intelligence cycle is a structured and continuous process of producing actionable cyber threat intelligence from raw data through processing and analysis.
