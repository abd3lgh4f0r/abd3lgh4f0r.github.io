**IPV6 ATTACK : Walkthrough and Mitigations**

**OVERVIEW**

In an Active Directory environment, The IPV6 is enabled in some machines, However, when attempting to reach the IPv6 DNS server, the request gets lost due to the absence of an IPv6 DNS server to resolve IPv6 addresses. This issue creates an opportunity for attackers to exploit the situation by impersonating a DNS server. They can then leverage this exploit to gain unauthorized access to the system or steal sensitive data such as credentials.

**ATTACK EXPLANATION**

To execute this attack, the attacker must establish a man-in-the-middle scenario. This involves setting up an attacker machine to intercept IPv6 traffic and pose as a DNS server for it. This can be illustrated with the image below:

**ATTACK WALKTHROUGH**

In this section we'll establish the required tools to carry out this attack.

Firstly we  need to install mitm6 tool to establish a man in the middle situation :

 Then  we install the requirements :

In order to establish an LDAP secured connexion we need to create an LDAPS certificate:


Before delving deeply into this we must explain what is LDAP,

LDAP : Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a protocol that applications can use to speak to directory services such as Active Directory. The LDAP protocol queries user information to read, modify or update it.

Now, we'll proceed with creating our LDAPS certificate :

Once the certificate is set up, we'll advance to the next stage, which involves handling attack.

Intially we set a man in the middle 6 ( **mimt6** ) :

Before proceeding to the next section, we need to clarify two key concepts that we'll be utilizing.

1-**WPAD**: WPAD stands for Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD). Essentially windows machine sends out these requests looking if there is a proxy server in the environment.

How this will be exploited : 
 
 When the attacker which is also the IPv6 DNS server get this request from the victims machine it respond with its own address. In order to get WPAD configuration the machine provides credentials which are captured by attackers machine and then used for more malicious purpos.


 2-**LOOT**: A directory where we will dump all the data we gather from the Domain controller.

So Let's , move to the next section :

At first we start an NTLM relay using this command :

```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://192.168.230.142 -wh fakewpad.domain.local -l loot

6:for IPV6
192.168.230.142 : Domain controller @IP 
wpad : fakewpad.domain.local
loot directory : loot 
```

To expedite the attack process, we will reboot the victim machine :

Going back to the NTLM relay session we can see that  the authentication has been succeed and  the data has been dumped into LOOT directory (/loot) :

We open a new terminal seesion to check the content of /loot :

let's  open one of this  files :

 **MITIGATIONS**

In my blog, I've chosen to talk about one of the recommended actions, which involves disabling the WinHttpAutoProxySvc Service

**WinHttpAutoProxySvc Service** :

The WinHTTP Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Service (WinHttpAutoProxySvc) implements the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) protocol for Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP). WPAD is a protocol that enables an HTTP client to automatically discover a proxy configuration.

Let's  disable the WinHttpAutoProxySvc service :
