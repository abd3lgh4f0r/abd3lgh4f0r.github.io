**IPV6 ATTACK : Walkthrough and Mitigations**

**OVERVIEW**

In an Active Directory environment, The IPV6 is enabled in some machines, However, when attempting to reach the IPv6 DNS server, the request gets lost due to the absence of an IPv6 DNS server to resolve IPv6 addresses. This issue creates an opportunity for attackers to exploit the situation by impersonating a DNS server. They can then leverage this exploit to gain unauthorized access to the system or steal sensitive data such as credentials.

**ATTACK EXPLANATION**

To execute this attack, the attacker must establish a man-in-the-middle scenario. This involves setting up an attacker machine to intercept IPv6 traffic and pose as a DNS server for it. This can be illustrated with the image below:

In this section we'll establish the required tools to carry out this attack.

Firstly we  need to install mitm6 tool to establish a man in the middle situation :

In order to establish an LDAP secured connexion we need to create an LDAPS certificat:


Before delving deeply into this we must explain what is LDAP,

LDAP : Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a protocol that applications can use to speak to directory services such as Active Directory. The LDAP protocol queries user information to read, modify or update it.
