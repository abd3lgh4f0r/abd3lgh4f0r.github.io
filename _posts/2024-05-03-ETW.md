**ETW : A POWERFULL LOGGING MECHANISM**

Hello friends, and welcome to a new blog!

In this blog, I've chosen to explain the intricacies of the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) mechanism and how it contributes to Event monitoring and Real-Time Analysis.

**OVERVIEW**


ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) is a logging mechanism in the Windows operating system that manages the logging process. It finds applications in various IT fields, including software engineering profiling, threat detection, and analysis. Additionally, EDR agents utilize ETW when collecting data from endpoints, enabling them to gather novel data for creating new alerts or enriching existing events.


**ETW COMPOUNENTS**

There are three main components involved in ETW: providers, consumers,and controllers. Each of these components serves a distinct purpose in an event-tracing session. The following overview describes how each component fits into the larger ETW architecture.

Let's proceed with **Providers** :

*Providers* are the applications in the system that emit events such as Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing which is responsible for logging security-related events in the Windows operating system. This provider is a crucial component of Windows Security Auditing and plays a vital role in monitoring and maintaining the security of the system.

*Providers* have GUIDs that other software can use to identify them , for example the Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing has this GUID :

 {54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d}


In addition to that we can  check the provider GUID by navigating to the details section within event viewer in windows :

Furthermore , providers have more user-friendly names, most often definedin their manifest, that allow humans to identify them more easily. There are around 1,100 providers registered in default Windows 10 installations.Table 8-1 includes those that endpoint security products might find helpful.

There are some   ETW Providers Relevant to Security Monitoring :

Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process , Microsoft-Antimalware-Scan-Interface


Moreover Providers are securable objects , means that  a security descriptor specifies who has permission to control the provider, subscribe to its events, and write events.

for instance  we will get the security desc of Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing using this script 
( i have took this code from the )

```powershell
PS > $SDs = Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Security
PS > $sddl = ([wmiclass]"Win32_SecurityDescriptorHelper").
>> BinarySDToSDDL($SDs.'0063715b-eeda-4007-9429-ad526f62696e').
>> SDDL
PS > ConvertFrom-SddlString -Sddl $sddl
```

The ouput :
