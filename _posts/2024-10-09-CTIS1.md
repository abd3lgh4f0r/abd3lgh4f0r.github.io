**Threat Intelligence: Intelligence Requirements**

Assalamo Alaykom Friends , Welcome to another blog in our series on Threat Intelligence. After covering the fundamentals of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), 
today we’ll dive into the first stage of the intelligence cycle: Planning and Direction. As we’ve explained before, this stage involves several key processes such as defining intelligence requirements and threat modeling. In today’s blog, 
we will focus on explaining intelligence requirements in detail. 

**What Are Intelligence Requirements ?**

Intelligence requirements (IRs) can be defined as the objectives set by an organization that guide the collection, analysis, and production of intelligence. These objectives define the organization's priorities in terms of intelligence needs, while also addressing the knowledge gaps that need to be filled.

The main goal of setting intelligence requirements is to understand what types of information are important for a given organization (for example, which types of intelligence the organization wants to collect).

**Threat Intelligence wihtout IRs ?**

Working with effective intelligence means reinforcing the security posture, proactively monitoring threats, and responding quickly to incidents. However, these fundamental concepts in the world of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) can sometimes not be fully realized if clear intelligence requirements are not properly set up.

What often happens is that some organizations misunderstand the intelligence process. They start by gathering every available Indicator of Compromise (IOC), subscribing to all threat feed vendors, and then dumping this data into their SIEM. This approach results in numerous useless alerts and false positives, overwhelming the security team and ultimately reducing overall effectiveness. Properly defined intelligence requirements are essential to filter relevant data, guide collection efforts, and enhance decision-making.

We have to remember that there is no universal intelligence that works for every organization. Each organization must align its threat intelligence processes with its own specific profile. For example, an organization using a particular type of technology will focus more on producing and collecting intelligence related to that technology, rather than on a technology they don’t use.

By aligning intelligence efforts with their specific needs, organizations can avoid unnecessary noise and help their security teams focus on relevant threats.


**Examples of Threat Intelligence**

When defining threat intelligence requirements, the process begins with formulating a set of questions that align with the organization's specific intelligence needs. The answers to these questions then serve as a guide for the entire intelligence cycle, helping to focus efforts on gathering, analyzing, and disseminating relevant and actionable intelligence.
